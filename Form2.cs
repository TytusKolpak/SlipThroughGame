That action is the Slip Through.\r\n    - If the player does so then their character receives a stat boost according to the character which they chose.\r\n    - Such action can be performed only once per wall, during the same life of the character. (Death resets it - after death character can slip again)\r\n - The order in which players move is set to warrior -> archer -> wizard, after last players turn end a new round begins.\r\n - Instead of movement, the player can choose to rest. If they do, then they stay on the tile they started and heal by 4HP (but limited by their maxHP).\r\n \r\n### Combat rules\r\n \r\n - Each of 3 players gets their own character with preset statistics to determine how the combat carries out: warrior, wizard, archer.\r\n - If you win combat you get a chance to choose a stat increase, any stat:\r\n    - +1 for wolf,\r\n    - +2 for werewolf and Cerberus.\r\n - For performing a Slip Through player's character gets stat boost:\r\n    - Warrior gets +1 defence, \r\n    - Wizard gets +1 attack,\r\n    - Archer gets +1 effectiveness.\r\n - Combat is carried in turns: first the player attack their enemy, and then the enemy attack the player\r\n    - Success of an attack is determined like so: if a dice roll is greater than effectiveness of the enemy lowered by effectiveness of the character, then an attack is successful, otherwise it fails and nothing happens.\r\n    - If an attack is successful then the attacking character deals damage equal to their attack lowered by defence of their enemy.\r\n - If the character dies, then it goes back to 1st tile with their health set to it's previous value lowered by 1 (each death lowers it further).\r\n - If the character kills its enemy then it receives a stat boost and stays on the tile the fight took place.\r\n\r\n### Statistics\r\n\r\nEach instance begins with the same amount of predefined statistics: attack, defence, effectiveness, health. Each value can go up only to it's max value and down to it's min value.\r\n\r\n|Name      |ATT  |maxATT|DEF  |maxDEF|EFF  |maxEFF|HP   |minHp|\r\n|---------:|:---:|:----:|:---:|:----:|:---:|:----:|:---:|:---:|\r\n|Warrior   |2    |6     |1    |6     |0    |6     |12   |7    |\r\n|Archer    |1    |6     |1    |3     |1    |12    |9    |5    |\r\n|Wizard    |3    |12    |0    |3     |0    |6     |8    |4    |\r\n|Shaman    |1    |6     |2    |3     |0    |6     |9    |6    |\r\n|Wolf      |3    |-     |0    |-     |3    |-     |5    |-    |\r\n|Werewolf  |4    |-     |1    |-     |5    |-     |7    |-    |\r\n|Cerberus  |5    |-     |3    |-     |8    |-     |10   |-    |\r\n|Ghost     |p-1  |-     |p-1  |-     |p+3  |-     |10   |-    |\r\n\r\nGhost's statistics are defined by the character who attacks it. It's attack is always equal to that of the character and decreased by 1. The same applies to defence. Effectiveness is increased by 3.\r\n \r\n ### Board form as depicted by tile numbers\r\n \r\n| 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | \r\n|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|\r\n| 10  | 9   | 8   | 7   | 6   |\r\n| 11  | 12  | 13  | 14  | 15  |\r\n| 20  | 19  | 18  | 17  | 16  |\r\n| 21  | 22  | 23  | 24  | 25  |\r\n| 30  | 29  | 28  | 27  | 26  |\r\n";
